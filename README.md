# VRProject-JRIEPLER

### Project description: 
There is a container as you will find one next to a bowling alley. Inside of that container are all planets of our sun system, includen Earth (globe).
Next to the container is a button, if u press the button, a gate on the wall in like 5 meter distance opens. The goal is to throw all planets through the gate. If a planet hits the ground between the container and the gat (5m distance), the ball respawns in the container, because there is a ledge next to the container so u cant just run up close to the gate.
